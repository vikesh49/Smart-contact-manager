This is a learning Project, the main objective of this project is to create an application that stores contacts in a very efficient way and provides a smarter way of handling contacts with full Authentication and Authorization. We created this project using Spring Boot Thymeleaf with MVC Architecture and for Authentication and Authorization we have used Spring Security.

Spring Boot is used to developing the back-end and Spring Data JPA is used for performing Database CRUD operations.
HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and Thymeleaf as template Engine is used to develop the front end.
SQLLite3 for Database.
For someone who wants to run this application in their IDE (system or Machine) can simply download and run this without any configuration changes. As I have used SQLLite3 for DATABASE it will generate a .db file as database. And you don't even need a username & password.
